# HowManyPizzas üçï

I present you a simple and nice application to calculate how much pizza we need to order for a given number of people at our party, for example! ü•≥ It was written in Swift language <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121167654/208907677-5933667b-c8bc-4c64-9344-ab32b8cffd9c.png" width="18"/>

## About my app 
HowManyPizzas is an app I decided to write to make life easier for all those people who always wonder if 3 pizzas are enough or if 4 are needed. Now with this app, all you have to do is choose the size of the pizza, enter the number of people to feed and how many slices one person will eat! Based on this, the app will calculate how many pizzas to order. It uses a simple formula provided by an American pizzeria. 

After launching the application, we will be shown a specially prepared launchscreen:

Next, the home screen is displayed:

After pressing the **START** button, we go to the view in which we fill in our data for calculations. The application has some limitations so that when one of the values has not been entered we get a popup with information to complete the data highlighting the missing data in red. In addition, I made a popup that shows when the number of people exceeds 50:

</div>

After entering all the data and pressing the **GET RESULT** button, the application displays a view showing the received result of how many pizzas the user should order. To recalculate the result just press the **CALC AGAIN** button to return to the view for the data:
